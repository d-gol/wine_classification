# Application of Neural Networks in wine classification

Dataset describes wines as a set of chemical features and a quality grade between 0 and 10. Dataset can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality.
The objective of the project is to:
- Implement Neural Network in Python
- Provide wine classification of the dataset provided
- Have balanced and presentable results
